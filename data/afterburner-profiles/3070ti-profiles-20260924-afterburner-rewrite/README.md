# RTX 3070 Ti profile store, as found 2026-09-24: rewritten by Afterburner, curves unchanged

**Verbatim copy** of `C:\Program Files (x86)\MSI Afterburner\Profiles\` from the shop machine, made
by Raymond after Session D's first launch that morning (`bench-session-20260924-081957`) stopped at
its first check: *Profile hash mismatch*. Nothing had been measured.

| file | SHA-256 (as written by Afterburner, CRLF) |
|---|---|
| `VEN_10DE&DEV_2482&…cfg` | `cce75e81fe322380…`, where 2026-09-23's snapshot is `1b08c2d0854460ff…` |

## What changed: two sections Afterburner added itself; the curves did not change

Compared key for key against `../3070ti-profiles-20260923/`:
- **`Startup`, `Profile1`, `Profile2` and `Profile3` are identical in every key, including every
  `VFCurve`.** So Session D's stock, Edit 1 and Edit 2 are exactly the decoded curves.
- **Two sections were added.**
  - `[Defaults]`: power limit 100, core +0, memory +0, fan 30, and a curve.
  - `[Settings]`: `CaptureDefaults=0`.
- **No other key was changed or removed.**

The `[Defaults]` curve is **not** Profile 1. It differs at three points, each by one 15 MHz step at
zero offset: 950 mV reads 1800 against 1785, 987.5 mV 1860 against 1845, and 1100 mV 1980 against
1965. It reads like the driver's default curve captured at a different moment, but that is an
inference, not established. **Session D never applies it**: the runs apply P1, P2 and P3 by
command line.

**Why the gate tripped:** the bench app hashes the whole file, so an added section fails it just as a
changed curve would. The gate did its job; the whole-file hash is simply stricter than "the curves
are the ones decoded". The Session D catalog now expects `CCE75E81FE322380`
(`tools/bench-app/catalog/build_sessiond.py`, with the reason beside it). **The load witnesses are
unchanged,** and they still check each profile's effect directly.

⚠️ **Not known:** what made Afterburner write these sections, or when between the shakedown's end
(2026-09-23 22:15) and 08:19 the next morning. If it happens again before Session D runs, the gate
stops the run the same way. That is safe, and this comparison can be repeated in a minute.
