Load and validate the GPU-DVFS-Dataset CSVs.

The three published CSVs are stored WIDE: one row per workload, one column per
GPU core frequency. Everything downstream wants LONG format, so this module does
the reshape once and validates the files against each other on the way through.

Source: https://github.com/zyjopensource/GPU-DVFS-Dataset
Hardware: a single NVIDIA V100 (TDP 300 W), 33 workloads, 13 core frequencies.
