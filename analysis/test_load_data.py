Known-answer checks for recomputeEfficiency and toLongFormat in load_data.py.

WHY THESE TWO
    Every V100 number in this project flows through them. recomputeEfficiency is the
    normalisation that makes efficiency comparable across workloads with different absolute
    power; toLongFormat reshapes three wide matrices into the tidy frame every downstream
    script consumes. A melt-and-merge bug there could pair one workload's power with
    another's performance and still emit a perfectly well-formed table with the right row
    count, which nothing downstream would notice.

    The misalignment check therefore verifies every cell against the matrix it came from
    rather than spot-checking a row.

PROVENANCE
    Drafted by a local model (qwen3-coder:30b via Ollama), then verified rather than trusted.
    Its misalignment check was WRONG - it expected row 1 to hold workload B at 757 MHz when
    rows sort by workload then frequency, making row 1 workload A at 1530 MHz. The function
    was correct; the test was not. Notably the same file asserted the correct ordering in its
    sorting check, so the model contradicted itself two checks apart. Corrected here and
    widened to cover all rows.

    Five deliberate mutations were then introduced into load_data.py - inverting the
    efficiency division, normalising by a shared scalar instead of per workload, normalising
    along the wrong axis, dropping the sort, and leaving frequency as a string - and all five
    were caught.

    Delete analysis/__pycache__ between mutations; a same-length edit can leave stale
    bytecode running while the source on disk reads correct.
