"""Checks for build_data_manifest.py.

The classification rules are the part worth testing. They are the kind of logic that fails
silently - a rule that stops matching drops real sweeps out of the count and the total still
looks plausible, which is precisely the failure this repository keeps finding elsewhere.

Every check here runs against SYNTHETIC sessions rather than the real tree, so a check cannot
start passing because the data changed. The two that do touch the real tree are marked, and they
assert invariants rather than totals - a totals assertion would go stale every collection run.
