Tests for the guards inside the 3070 Ti cross-chip claims.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHAT IT IS FOR
    Four of the claims in claims_crosschip.py carry a check that raises when the DATA stops
    supporting the sentence around it, rather than merely changing a number: the OC BIOS drawing
    more power at every matched point, the silent run being the hotter one, neither BIOS reaching
    its clock ceiling, and the two membw sweeps sharing all thirteen targets.

    A mutation run showed all four surviving deletion, because against today's data the guard
    condition is false and removing it changes nothing observable. That is the same trap recorded
    three times in test_audit_claims.py: a check that cannot be observed to fail is not a check.

    So each test below feeds one guard the data it exists to reject, and then feeds it data it
    should accept - because a guard that raises unconditionally is no better than one that never
    raises.
