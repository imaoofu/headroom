"""
Characterise the dataset before modelling anything.

Two questions this answers, both of which the prediction script depends on:

  1. How much efficiency does running at stock frequency actually give up?
     That gap is the whole point of the project, so it gets measured first,
     from published data, before any model exists to take credit for it.

  2. Do workloads differ enough for a per-workload prediction to be worth making?
     If every workload peaked at the same frequency, one lookup table would beat
     any model and the project would need a different question.
