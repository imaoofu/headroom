"""Claims about the REPOSITORY's own state, pinned against CLAUDE.md.

WHY THIS MODULE IS NOT SPLIT BY HARDWARE LIKE THE OTHER THREE
    claims_consumer / claims_crosschip / claims_reference are split by which CARD the data came
    from, because a shared constant between them is how a claim would silently read the wrong
    hardware. Nothing here reads hardware at all - these claims read the claims registry and the
    paper's own headings. A fourth hardware module would be the wrong shape; this is a different
    axis, and it says so rather than being inferred.

WHY CLAUDE.md IS AUDITED AT ALL
    Its claim count went stale four times - 87 -> 119 -> 185 -> 204 - and on 2026-08-30 it carried
    TWO CONTRADICTORY counts for one quantity simultaneously, which is worse than one stale number
    because neither can be trusted and nothing flags which is which. The file already tells readers
    to run --coverage instead of believing it. This makes that instruction unnecessary for the four
    numbers below, which is better than repeating it.

    ⚠️ WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It pins NUMBERS, never sentences. CLAUDE.md is the file
    that gets edited most and edited fastest, and an auditor that fails on a rephrased clause would
    be a tax on the thing the file is for. Every claim here renders the shortest substring that
    contains the digits and nothing else.

    It also cannot pin the check count from `run_tests.py`. That number is produced by a different
    runner counting a different thing, and a second implementation of it here would be two counting
    methods that can disagree - the exact failure this project keeps finding. CLAUDE.md points at
    `run_tests.py` for that one instead.

🔑 THE ENVIRONMENT SPLIT, AND WHY IT IS ONE CLAIM PER LEG RATHER THAN TWO EVERYWHERE
    `data/raw/` is gitignored and fetched, so claims_reference registers its 28 claims only when it
    is present, and the registry is 25 larger there once header-pinned-count is counted. A claim
    can therefore only honestly pin the total for the environment it is RUNNING in - `len(CLAIMS)`
    is the with-reference total in one leg and the without-reference total in the other, and there
    is no way to compute the other one that is not a hardcoded subtraction pretending to be a
    measurement.

    So exactly one of the two total claims registers in any given run, and each CI leg verifies its
    own number. Between them both figures in CLAUDE.md's table are covered, and neither is guessed.
    An unguarded version of this idea broke both checks legs on 2026-09-02.
