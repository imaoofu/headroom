# and topped out at 2130 MHz, against 115 entries and 2115 the day before. Session D2's top six
# targets moved by 15 MHz, and its registered prediction (8d), which named Session D's grid, became
# NOT SCOREABLE after three hours of collection. A catalog can now state the table top its grid
# needs, and the engine refuses at the start instead.
