  One focused membw sweep over the plateau band, with a caller-supplied label.

  BACKGROUND
      The 2026-08-19 tuned run sat flat at ~295 GB/s across 1545-1852 MHz while the stock run
      rose 312 -> 332 -> 342. A clean re-run with no stability logger reproduced the plateau to
      within 1%, and memory clock telemetry (added to the sweep tool for that run) showed a
      rock-steady 16301 MHz at every point. Throttle masks are clean in all three runs. So the
      plateau is not the logger, not a memory downclock, and not throttling.

      The remaining hypothesis is the core V/F curve: the tuned profile pins it flat near
      3000 MHz at and above ~925 mV, so locking the SM clock into the plateau band forces a
      voltage selection BELOW the flattened region, where the custom and stock curves diverge
      most. Separating the memory overclock from the core curve settles it.

  USAGE
      -Label memonly    memory overclock only, core V/F curve reverted to stock
      -Label oc         both applied (the original tuned configuration)
      -Label stock      neither

      -Workload membw   default. Sweeps 1400-2100 MHz over the plateau band, 10 points.
      -Workload gemm    sweeps the FULL default 13-point grid (1237-3090 MHz), which is the
                        exact grid both existing gemm sweeps used, so the three configurations
                        are comparable at identical targets rather than nearest-neighbours.

  WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT RUNNING
      No stability logger. The first tuned run had one spawning nvidia-smi once per second and
      the stock run did not, which made them methodologically different. Nothing else may touch
      the GPU during this.
