.SYNOPSIS
    Sweeps locked GPU core clocks and measures power at each one, to build a
    frequency-power-efficiency curve on real consumer hardware.

.DESCRIPTION
    This is the consumer-hardware equivalent of the public GPU-DVFS-Dataset: for each
    of N core frequencies, pin the clock, hold a load, and record what the card draws.

    Unlike Log-GpuStability.ps1 (which only observes), this script DOES change GPU state -
    it locks the core clock via nvidia-smi. That makes the reset path the most important
    code here, not the measurement:

      * The sweep body is wrapped in try/finally. The finally ALWAYS runs -rgc.
      * After resetting it READS BACK the clock state and shouts if the reset did not take.
      * Ctrl+C is intercepted rather than allowed to kill the process, so it unwinds
        through the same reset path instead of leaving the card pinned.
      * Clock locks do not survive a reboot, so a total loss of the process is recoverable
        by restarting the machine. Say so out loud if that ever happens.

    WORKLOAD: the GPU must be under sustained load or every measurement is an idle
    measurement. Two ways to supply it:

      -WorkloadCommand "<cmd>"   the script runs this at each frequency and times it.
                                 Duration becomes the performance metric (fixed work,
                                 varying clock), which is what makes efficiency computable.

      (nothing)                  the script assumes YOU started a load externally (OCCT,
                                 FurMark, a game) and just measures power. Gives the
                                 power curve but NOT performance, so efficiency cannot
                                 be computed from that run alone.

.PARAMETER SessionLabel
    Short name for this sweep. Becomes part of the output filename.

.PARAMETER WorkloadCommand
    Optional. Command run at each frequency; its wall-clock duration is recorded as the
    performance metric. Must be fixed-work (same amount of work every time), not fixed-time.

.PARAMETER FrequencyCount
    How many frequencies to test across the swept range. Default 13, matching the public
    V100 dataset's grid so the two are directly comparable.

.PARAMETER MinFrequencyPercent
    Floor of the sweep, as a percentage of the card's max clock. Default 40.

    Consumer cards report absurdly low clocks as "supported" - an RTX 5060 Ti offers 180 MHz,
    under 6% of its 3090 MHz max. Sweeping evenly from there wastes a third of the run on
    frequencies that will never be efficiency-optimal for real work, and makes any fixed-work
    benchmark crawl. The public V100 dataset only swept 757-1530 MHz, i.e. 49-100% of its max,
    and found its optimum at 62%. This default keeps the grid concentrated where the answer
    actually lives. Lower it if a card's optimum looks like it sits at the floor.

.PARAMETER MinFrequencyMhz
.PARAMETER MaxFrequencyMhz
    Absolute bounds on the swept band, in MHz. Both default to 0, meaning "unset" - the grid then
    runs from the MinFrequencyPercent floor to the card's maximum, as before.

    These exist for FINE sweeps: once a coarse sweep has bracketed the efficiency optimum, the
    useful next run concentrates all N points into the neighbourhood of the peak rather than
    re-measuring a range whose shape is already known. MinFrequencyPercent cannot express that,
    since it only moves the floor.

    A fine sweep needs enough span to be worth fitting. Near its optimum an efficiency curve is
    flat by construction, so a band tight around the peak buys resolution in frequency and pays
    for it in signal: if the curve only falls a percent or two across the whole band, per-point
    noise decides which point wins. Choose a band across which efficiency visibly falls.

.PARAMETER SettleSeconds
    Wait after locking a clock before measuring, so the card reaches steady state. Default 8.

.PARAMETER MeasureSeconds
    How long to sample telemetry at each frequency. Default 20. Applies only when NO
    -WorkloadCommand is given; with a workload, sampling runs for as long as it runs.

.PARAMETER Descending
    Walk the frequency grid from HIGHEST to LOWEST instead of the default lowest-to-highest.

    ⛔ ADDED 2026-09-15 BECAUSE THE DEFAULT ORDER IS A CONFOUND AND NOTHING HERE COULD VARY IT.
    A sweep that climbs in frequency also warms the card as it goes, so frequency and temperature
    rise together and any voltage that changes with temperature is indistinguishable from one that
    changes with clock. The RTX 2060 Super fine-floor sweep of 2026-09-15 measured core voltage
    FALLING 0.644 -> 0.631 V from 900 to 1005 MHz while the card went 42.0 -> 58.7 C; above
    1005 MHz the temperature had saturated and the voltage rise there is attributable, but the
    fall is not. Every load-floor measurement in this project was taken ascending.

    Running the identical grid both ways separates them. Nothing else about the sweep changes.

.PARAMETER SampleIntervalSeconds
    Telemetry sampling period, in seconds. Default 0.5.

    When a workload is supplied, power is averaged over only the benchmark's timed region
    (see below), which is a window of roughly 8-10 seconds. At the old 1 s period that left
    under ten samples to average; 0.5 s doubles the resolution for a cost of ~42 ms per
    nvidia-smi call, on a thread that is otherwise sleeping.

.PARAMETER MinFreeVramMb
    Refuse to start unless at least this much VRAM is free, in MB. Default 4000, which is not a
    round number chosen for looking sensible - membw allocates three 256M-float buffers totalling
    3.07 GB and gemm about 0.8 GB, and the CUDA context costs a few hundred MB on top. It is the
    SAME constant tools/collection-kit/preflight.py already enforces (REQUIRED_VRAM_BYTES), and
    they are deliberately identical: two guards on the same quantity that disagree are worse than
    one, because a run refused by one tool and accepted by the other tells the operator nothing.
    Set to 0 to disable, and say so in -AppliedSettings if you do.

.PARAMETER MaxBaselineUtilization
    Refuse to start if the GPU is already busier than this percentage before our workload
    runs. Default 10.

    This guard protects the whole dataset. A sweep run while a game, a video, a local LLM
    server or an animated wallpaper is on the card measures that load mixed with ours at
    every frequency, inseparably. The output looks like ordinary data and is worthless.

.PARAMETER AllowVideoEngines
    Proceed even though NVENC/NVDEC are active. Off by default, and it should stay off.

    An always-on clipper is the most damaging contaminant this project has measured, precisely
    because it is invisible - no window, enabled by default, and running on engines that
    utilization.gpu does not report. Use this switch only to measure contaminated conditions
    deliberately, as a control, and say so in -AppliedSettings when you do.

.PARAMETER AppliedSettings
    Free text describing the GPU configuration this run was made under - the V/F curve shape,
    memory offset, power limit, and anything else changed by hand before starting.

    This is the only field in the output that nothing else can reconstruct afterwards. Clocks,
    power and throughput are all measured; what was DELIBERATELY SET is not, because it is set
    outside this tool in Afterburner, and the card does not report the curve back. A sweep whose
    configuration is unknown can still be compared against itself, but it cannot be compared
    against anything else, which is most of what a sweep is for.

    Learned the hard way: two runs on 2026-08-21 produced the best result recorded on this card
    and it was not possible, the following morning, to say from the repo what curve had produced
    it. Voltage telemetry could confirm the lower half of the curve and nothing above 2100 MHz.

    Be specific enough to reproduce. "split curve, stock slope below 845 mV, tuned flat shape
    850-920 mV, top point 920 mV at 3000 MHz, memory +2500, power limit 111%" is the standard;
    "tuned" is not.

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Plan the sweep and print the frequencies WITHOUT touching GPU state. Always do this first.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Invoke-FrequencySweep.ps1 -SessionLabel "5060ti-baseline" -DryRun

.EXAMPLE
    .\Invoke-FrequencySweep.ps1 -SessionLabel "5060ti-baseline" -MeasureSeconds 25

.NOTES
    Requires an ELEVATED shell. nvidia-smi clock locking needs administrator rights;
    the script checks and refuses to start otherwise rather than failing halfway through.
