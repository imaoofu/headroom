  Does the stability logger actually NOTICE a failure?

  The logger has never been tested against one. It has only ever been run on sessions that
  went fine, which means a logger that unconditionally reported CLEAN would have looked
  identical so far. ROADMAP lists this as [CORE] and it has sat undone since the beginning.

  Three cases, and the first one is the reason this is a real test rather than a formality:

    1. POSITIVE CONTROL - sustained load for the whole window. Must report CLEAN.
       Without this, a logger stuck on INCONCLUSIVE would "pass" cases 2 and 3.
    2. LOAD NEVER STARTS - logger runs over an idle GPU. Must NOT report CLEAN.
       This is the failure mode the logger's own comments say was found the hard way: a
       session reported CLEAN with plausible-looking averages that described an idle card.
    3. LOAD DIES PARTWAY - load covers roughly a third of the window, then stops. Must NOT
       report CLEAN. This is what a stress test crashing actually looks like from here.

  Exit codes from the logger carry the verdict: 0 CLEAN, 1 FLAGGED, 2 UNSTABLE, 3 INCONCLUSIVE.
