.SYNOPSIS
    Positive control: prove Invoke-StabilityProtocol.ps1 refuses when its logger fails to start.

.DESCRIPTION
    On 2026-08-23 the protocol harness started its telemetry logger with Start-Process
    -ArgumentList, which does not reliably quote array elements containing spaces. The settings
    string split, "TEST" landed on -IntervalSeconds, and the logger died on parameter binding
    before writing a single sample.

    The harness did not notice. It ran a full six-minute load phase against a dead logger, then
    read that process's exit code of 1, mapped it through its own verdict table to FLAGGED, and
    printed a combined verdict. **The failure did not look like a failure.** It produced a
    plausible telemetry verdict from a component that had never sampled anything, and had the
    exit code been 0 it would have said CLEAN.

    That is the same class of defect as the INCONCLUSIVE verdict the logger itself gained on
    2026-08-20, one level up: a tool that cannot distinguish "the telemetry is clean" from "there
    is no telemetry".

    This test reintroduces the exact bug into a COPY of the harness and asserts that it now
    refuses, quickly, without running any load. A fix verified only against the working case is
    not verified - which is the lesson Test-LoggerCatchesFailure.ps1 recorded when two mutations
    survived because the check asserted an outcome the mutation also produced.
