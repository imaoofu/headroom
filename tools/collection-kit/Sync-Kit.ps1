.SYNOPSIS
    Copy the current tooling into an already-built collection kit, and prove it landed.

.DESCRIPTION
    The kit is not committed to the repository - it carries a ~4.65 GB copy of Python and
    PyTorch. So the kit on the USB drive is a SNAPSHOT, and it silently rots every time the
    tooling in the repository changes.

    It had rotted badly by 2026-08-23, three days before a build. The kit was carrying:

      - Invoke-FrequencySweep.ps1 at schema 0.1.0 against the repository's 0.3.0, so it had
        neither -AppliedSettings nor the video-engine guard - the two things added specifically
        to stop the contamination that cost this project two days of re-measurement.
      - A Collect.ps1 that hardcoded "-stock" into the session label, so an overclocked run
        wrote files named  <label>-oc-gemm-stock_sweep.csv  and read as stock data to anyone
        scanning the directory later.
      - A stability logger without the BOM fix, whose session.json broke every standard JSON
        parser.

    None of those announce themselves. Each one produces a run that looks completely successful
    and is quietly worth less than it should be. This script exists so that "is the kit current?"
    is one command with a verifiable answer, rather than a thing to remember.

    It copies TOOLING ONLY. Python, PyTorch and collected results are never touched, so running
    this on a kit with data in it is safe.

.PARAMETER KitPath
    The existing kit folder, e.g. F:\headroom-kit.

.PARAMETER WhatIfOnly
    Report what differs and change nothing.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Sync-Kit.ps1 -KitPath F:\headroom-kit -WhatIfOnly
    .\Sync-Kit.ps1 -KitPath F:\headroom-kit
