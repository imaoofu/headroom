<#
.SYNOPSIS
    One-command Headroom data collection for a machine that has nothing installed.

.DESCRIPTION
    Runs a stock frequency sweep for both workloads and writes everything into results\.
    Uses the portable Python bundled in this kit, so NOTHING is installed on the target
    machine and nothing is left behind when the folder is deleted.

    Designed to be run without anyone available to debug it. Every step that can fail is
    checked up front, and the script refuses to start rather than failing halfway and
    leaving the GPU clock-locked.

.NOTES
    Launch via RUN-ME.bat, which handles elevation. Running this directly needs an
    already-elevated PowerShell.

# ---- MEASURED MEMORY CLOCK UNDER LOAD -------------------------------------------------------
# Nothing else in this kit can tell a stock card from a tuned one. `clocks.max.memory` reports
# the same value either way - it is the P-state ceiling, not the applied clock - so a card with a
# vendor memory offset live looks identical to one without until it is put under load. That
# mistake has been made in this project: a run was labelled "memory untouched, verified stock"
# on 2026-08-30 while a +2500 offset was applied, and only the run's own telemetry caught it.
#
# WHY THE TOLERANCE IS 400 MHz AND NOT TIGHTER. The probe takes the MAXIMUM clock seen while the
# workload runs, and the memory briefly touches its top P-state on the way up. Measured on this
# 5060 Ti at stock on 2026-09-04, minutes apart: one run reported 13801 and the next 14001, from
# the same card in the same configuration. A 150 MHz tolerance refused the second one - a false
# refusal on a perfectly good card, found by running the check rather than by reading it. The
# tolerance therefore has to clear ~200 MHz of P-state jitter while still catching a real offset,
# and the smallest offset worth catching on this card is +2500. 400 sits an order of magnitude
# away from the thing it must reject and twice as far as the thing it must tolerate.
#
# WHY THIS MEASURES ALWAYS AND REFUSES ONLY SOMETIMES. On a card you know, pass
# -ExpectedMemoryClockMhz and a mismatch stops the run before any data is collected. On a card
# you do not - a borrowed machine, a model this kit has never seen - the stock value is not
# known in advance and there is nothing to compare against. Refusing would be useless and
# guessing would be worse, so the clock is measured, printed loudly, and written into
# machine-info.txt where the provenance of the run can be checked afterwards. Measuring without
# a verdict is weaker than refusing, and much stronger than the nothing that was here before.
