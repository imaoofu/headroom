<#
.SYNOPSIS
    One-command Headroom data collection for a machine that has nothing installed.

.DESCRIPTION
    Runs a stock frequency sweep for both workloads and writes everything into results\.
    Uses the portable Python bundled in this kit, so NOTHING is installed on the target
    machine and nothing is left behind when the folder is deleted.

    Designed to be run without anyone available to debug it. Every step that can fail is
    checked up front, and the script refuses to start rather than failing halfway and
    leaving the GPU clock-locked.

.NOTES
    Launch via RUN-ME.bat, which handles elevation. Running this directly needs an
    already-elevated PowerShell.
