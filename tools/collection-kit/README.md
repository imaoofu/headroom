# Collection kit

A self-contained folder that runs a stock frequency sweep on a machine with **nothing
installed** — no Python, no PyTorch, no admin setup beyond one UAC click. Built for shop
builds, where the machine belongs to a customer, time is short, and nobody is available to
debug a failure.

Delete the folder when done and the machine is exactly as it was.

## What it collects

Two 13-point sweeps at stock (`gemm` and `membw`), plus a `machine-info.txt` recording GPU,
driver, VBIOS, CPU, RAM and OS. **About 15 minutes total**, measured — not estimated:

| sweep | duration on an RTX 5060 Ti |
|---|---|
| `gemm`, 13 points | 6 min 42 s |
| `membw`, 13 points | 5 min 11 s |

This matters because `ROADMAP.md` and the original execution plan both budgeted ~5 hours per
machine, which is why collection felt too expensive to start. It is not. A sweep is a coffee
break, and the correction is what makes per-build collection realistic.

## Building the kit

The kit is not committed here — it contains a 4.65 GB copy of Python and PyTorch. Rebuild it:

```powershell
# 1. Copy a working Python that already has torch+cu128 installed.
robocopy "C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312" "E:\headroom-kit\python" /E /MT:16

# 2. Copy the tooling.
mkdir E:\headroom-kit\tools\frequency-sweep, E:\headroom-kit\tools\stability-logger, E:\headroom-kit\results
copy tools\frequency-sweep\Invoke-FrequencySweep.ps1  E:\headroom-kit\tools\frequency-sweep\
copy tools\frequency-sweep\gpu_workload.py            E:\headroom-kit\tools\frequency-sweep\
copy tools\Disable-QuickEdit.ps1                      E:\headroom-kit\tools\
copy tools\stability-logger\Log-GpuStability.ps1      E:\headroom-kit\tools\stability-logger\

# 3. Copy this directory's Collect.ps1, RUN-ME.bat and CHECKLIST.txt to E:\headroom-kit\
```

Then verify before trusting it:

```powershell
E:\headroom-kit\python\python.exe -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

## Keeping the kit current — do this before every build

**The kit is a snapshot, and it rots.** Because the 4.65 GB Python copy keeps it out of version
control, nothing links the tooling on the USB drive to the tooling in this repository. Every
improvement made here has to be carried across by hand, and a kit that is a version behind still
runs perfectly and still prints `COLLECTION SUCCEEDED`.

```powershell
.\tools\collection-kit\Sync-Kit.ps1 -KitPath F:\headroom-kit -WhatIfOnly   # report
.\tools\collection-kit\Sync-Kit.ps1 -KitPath F:\headroom-kit               # apply
```

It copies tooling only — Python, PyTorch and any collected results are never touched — then
re-hashes every file to confirm the copy landed, and prints the sweep's schema version, which is
the field stamped into every session JSON the kit produces.

**This is not hypothetical maintenance.** Checked on 2026-08-23, three days before a build, the
kit was carrying:

| file | state on the kit | consequence |
|---|---|---|
| `Invoke-FrequencySweep.ps1` | schema 0.1.0 vs 0.3.0 | no `-AppliedSettings`, **no video-engine guard** |
| `Collect.ps1` | pre-08-19 | hardcoded `-stock` into the label, so an OC run wrote `…-oc-gemm-stock_sweep.csv` |
| `Log-GpuStability.ps1` | pre-08-20 | `session.json` written with a UTF-8 BOM, unreadable by any standard JSON parser |
| `CHECKLIST.txt` | pre-08-22 | no mention of Instant Replay, the contaminant that cost this project two days |

Not one of those announces itself at collection time. Each produces a run that looks completely
successful and is quietly worth less than it should be.

**A plain copy of a normal Python install is relocatable** — verified on a different drive
letter, CUDA still detected, and the workload returned 412 GB/s against 415 GB/s from the
installed copy. An embeddable-Python build is not required and is harder to get right.

First `import torch` from cold storage takes ~45 s; subsequent imports are ~1.5 s once the OS
caches the DLLs. The sweep launches Python once per frequency, so this is a one-off cost, not
13 × 45 s. Copying the kit to the target machine's local disk before running keeps it fast.

## Two things that will bite whoever rebuilds this

**Paths must not contain spaces.** `Invoke-FrequencySweep.ps1` hands its `-WorkloadCommand`
string to `cmd /c` via `Start-Process -ArgumentList`, which mangles embedded quotes. Measured
directly: the quoted form fails with *"The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is
incorrect"*, the unquoted form runs fine. The existing sweeps only ever worked because they
used unquoted relative paths. `Collect.ps1` resolves 8.3 short names and refuses up front if
the resulting command still contains a space — because discovering this halfway through a
clock-locked sweep is much worse than refusing to start.

**`tuning_state_claimed` is an assertion the script cannot verify.** Nothing in `nvidia-smi`
reliably reports whether an Afterburner profile is applied, so that field records what the
operator was *supposed* to do — and it would say `STOCK` just as confidently on a run where
someone forgot. This is the same gap that made an earlier stability run unusable.

The fix is that the kit also appends `peak_sm_clock_mhz[<workload>]`, taken from the achieved
clock the sweep already records. That is a measurement, not a claim, and on a known model the
stock/tuned gap dwarfs run-to-run noise — on this RTX 5060 Ti, **2588 MHz stock against
~2950 MHz tuned**.

**Peak clock is recorded per workload and must never be pooled.** The two workloads draw
different power and so reach different clocks at identical settings: measured at stock,
`gemm` 2598 MHz against `membw` 2753 MHz — a 165 MHz spread from workload alone. A pooled
figure reports membw's 2753 and invites comparison against gemm's ~2597 stock reference, which
looks like a 156 MHz overclock and is nothing of the sort. Compare each workload only against
the same workload's reference.

## Running it

`RUN-ME.bat` — double-click, click Yes on UAC, type a label, wait. Full operator instructions,
including every failure message and what to do about it, are in `CHECKLIST.txt`. That file is
written to be printed and followed by someone who has never seen the project.
