.SYNOPSIS
    Run one logged sweep start to finish, with no human and no GUI interaction by any agent.

.DESCRIPTION
    Reads a JOB FILE, validates every field, then does the whole boundary sequence itself:

        preflight -> HWiNFO log start -> frequency sweep -> HWiNFO log stop -> result file

    Designed to be the ONLY thing a scheduled task runs, so that an unelevated agent can trigger
    a bench run with `schtasks /run` and never touch an elevated window. See README.md for why
    that indirection is necessary rather than merely tidy (UIPI; the Codex MSIX cannot elevate).

.PARAMETER JobPath
    The job file. Defaults to the fixed location the scheduled task uses.

.PARAMETER WhatIfOnly
    Validate the job and print the plan. Changes no GPU state, starts no log.

.NOTES
    🛑 THE SECURITY RULE THIS SCRIPT ENFORCES, AND WHY IT IS NOT PARANOIA.
        The scheduled task runs ELEVATED. If the job file could name the command to run, or the
        path to write, then any process that can write a file would have arbitrary administrator
        execution. So:

          - The workload COMMAND is constructed here from a whitelisted workload NAME. The job
            file cannot supply a command line.
          - The output directory is DERIVED from the label. The job file cannot supply a path,
            so path traversal has nothing to traverse.
          - Every numeric field is range-checked, and the label is pattern-matched.
          - Anything unrecognised is a refusal, not a default.

        The job file is a REQUEST. It is never an instruction.
